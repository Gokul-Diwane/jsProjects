🎯 Number Guessing Game
A fun and interactive number guessing game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

📜 How to Play
The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.

You have 10 attempts to guess the correct number.

After each guess, you will get hints:

"Your guess is lower!!!" if your guess is too small.

"Your guess is higher!!!" if your guess is too large.

If you guess correctly, you win!

If you run out of attempts, the game ends and shows the correct number.

You can start a new game after finishing.
